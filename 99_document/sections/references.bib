 abstract = {Many widely used economic models implicitly assume that income shares should be identical across time and space. Although time‐series data from industrial countries appear consistent with this notion, cross‐section data generally appear to contradict the assumption. A commonly used calculation suggests that labor shares of national income vary from about .05 to about .80 in international cross‐section data. This paper suggests that the usual approach underestimates labor income in small firms. Several adjustments for calculating labor shares are identified and compared. They all yield labor shares for most countries in the range of .65–.80.},

abstract = {We study the role of structural change on convergence in Italy by investigating the shifting of the labor force from agricultural to the manufacturing, market service, and nonmarket service sectors during the years of the Italian economic miracle. We find that the standard capital deepening mechanism was not the one that worked for convergence, rather it was structural change. Furthermore, we document that such a role was heterogeneous between the Center-Northern and the Southern regions. Finally, notwithstanding the huge internal and international migration flows that occurred during this period, we detect no significant role of migration in the convergence process.}
